This project is my submission for Lab 2 – Introduction to React. It extends the tutorial React app by adding four custom components and a small CSS change.

Implemented Features
Counter (Counter.jsx): Uses React state to display a number and lets the user increment, decrement, and reset it.

Text Input (TextInput.jsx): A controlled text input that shows what the user has typed below the field.

Image Display (Image.jsx): Renders a heading and an image (basketball picture) on the page.

Props Display (PropsDisplay.jsx): Accepts a prop (e.g., message) and displays its value, demonstrating how props work.

CSS for ordered list (App.css): Added an .ordered-list class that left‑aligns the text and uses a more playful generic font.

To run the project, install dependencies with npm install (and in any separate client/server folders if needed), then start the dev server with npm run dev and open the shown localhost URL in a browser.
